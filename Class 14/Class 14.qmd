## Background

Here we work through a complete RNASeq analysis project. The input data comes from a knock-down experiment of a HOX gene

## Data Import

Reading the `counts` and `metadata` CSV files

```{r}
counts <- read.csv("GSE37704_featurecounts.csv", row.names = 1)

metadata <- read.csv("GSE37704_metadata.csv")
```


Check on data structure

```{r}
head(counts)
```

Some book-keeping is required as there looks to be a mismatch between metadata rows and counts column.

```{r}
ncol(counts)
```

```{r}
nrow(metadata)
```


Looks like we need to get rid of the first "length" column of our `counts` object.
>Q. Complete the code below to remove the troublesome first column from countData


```{r}
cleancounts <- counts[,-1]
```

```{r}
colnames(cleancounts)
```

 
```{r}
metadata$id
```

```{r}
all( colnames(cleancounts) == metadata$id)
```

### Remove zero count genes

There are lots of genes with zero counts. We can remove these from further analysis. 
```{r}
head(cleancounts)
```

>Q. Complete the code below to filter countData to exclude genes (i.e. rows) where we have 0 read count across all samples (i.e. columns).

```{r}
to.keep.inds <- rowSums(cleancounts) > 0
nonzero_counts <- cleancounts[to.keep.inds,]
```


## DESeq analysis

Load the package

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(DESeq2)
```

Setup DESeq

```{r}
dds <- DESeqDataSetFromMatrix(countData = nonzero_counts ,
                              colData = metadata,
                              design =  ~condition )
```

run DESeq

```{r}
dds <- DESeq(dds)
```

get results

```{r}
res <- results(dds)
```

>Q. Call the summary() function on your results to get a sense of how many genes are up or down-regulated at the default 0.1 p-value cutoff.

```{r}
summary(res)
```


## Data Visualization

Volcano plot

```{r}
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(res) + 
  aes(log2FoldChange, -log(padj) ) +
  geom_point()


```

Add threshold lines for fold-change and P-value and color our subset of genes that make these threshold cut-offs in the plot
>Q. Improve this plot by completing the below code, which adds color and axis labels

```{r}
ggplot(res) + 
  aes(log2FoldChange, -log(padj), 
      color = abs(log2FoldChange) > 2 & abs(-log(padj)) > 0.05) + 
  geom_point() + 
  scale_color_manual(values = c("blue", "black")) + 
  geom_vline(xintercept=c(-2,2), col="red") + 
  geom_hline(yintercept = -log(0.05), c)

```

## Add Annotation

>Q. Use the mapIDs() function multiple times to add SYMBOL, ENTREZID and GENENAME annotation to our results by completing the code below.

Add gene symbols and entrez ids

```{r}
library(AnnotationDbi)
library(org.Hs.eg.db)
```

```{r}
res$symbol <- mapIds(x=org.Hs.eg.db,
       keys=row.names(res),
       keytype = "ENSEMBL", 
       column = "SYMBOL" )

res$entrez <- mapIds(x=org.Hs.eg.db,
       keys=row.names(res),
       keytype = "ENSEMBL", 
       column = "ENTREZID" )
```
  
## Pathway Analysis


Run gage analysis

```{r}
library(gage)
library(gageData)
library(pathview)

```

We need a named vector of fold-change values as input for gage

```{r}
foldchanges = res$log2FoldChange
names(foldchanges) = res$entrez
head(foldchanges)
```
```{r}
library(pathview)
```

```{r}
data(kegg.sets.hs)
data(sigmet.idx.hs)

kegg.sets.hs = kegg.sets.hs[sigmet.idx.hs]

head(kegg.sets.hs, 3)

```


```{r}
foldchanges = res$log2FoldChange
names(foldchanges) = res$entrez
head(foldchanges)
```

```{r}
data("kegg.gs")
keggres = gage(foldchanges, gsets=kegg.sets.hs)
```

```{r}
attributes(keggres)
```

```{r}
head(keggres$less, 5)
```

```{r}
pathview(gene.data=foldchanges, pathway.id="hsa03030")

```

```{r}
pathview(pathway.id = "hsa04110", gene.data = foldchanges)
```

![](hsa04110.pathview.png)

>Q. Can you do the same procedure as above to plot the pathview figures for the top 5 down-reguled pathways?

![](hsa03030.pathview.png)



### GO terms

Same analysis but using GO genesets rather than KEGG

```{r}
data(go.sets.hs)
data(go.subs.hs)

# Focus on Biological Process subset of GO
gobpsets = go.sets.hs[go.subs.hs$BP]

gobpres = gage(foldchanges, gsets=gobpsets)
```

```{r}
head(gobpres$less, 4)
```

### Reactome

Lots of folks like the reactome web interface. You can also run this as an R function but lts look at the website first. < https://reactome.org/ >

The website wants a text file with one gene symbol per line of the genes you want to map to pathways.

```{r}
sig_genes <- res[res$padj <= 0.05 & !is.na(res$padj), ]$symbol
head(sig_genes) #res$symbol
```
and write out to a file

```{r}
write.table(sig_genes, file="significant_genes.txt", row.names=FALSE, col.names=FALSE, quote=FALSE)
```

>Q: What pathway has the most significant “Entities p-value”? Do the most significant pathways listed match your previous KEGG results? What factors could cause differences between the two methods?

The cell cycle had the most significant "Entities p-value" but many were sufficiently significant. They show similar results but this method displays much more entities in total and with a similar type of diagram.

## Save our Results

```{r}
write.csv(res, file="myresults.csv")
```
